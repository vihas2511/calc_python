1) Main difference in refactor

The refactored new file consolidates and modularizes the logic spread across:

get_table_check_error_report

get_discr_report

get_missing_data_report

Utility/helper methods like unpivoting and cleaning

2) function difference 

older                          
unpivot_dataframe() and 
trim_and_replace_nulls_with_
empty_string_in_columns()

vs 

New

Inlined directly in the logic

3) some important key points 

Redundant function calls and excessive logging were removed.

Unpivoting logic is now local to the comparison function.

Union of discrepancy and missing reports done directly with column renaming

calc analysis
used in utility older
1) get_spark_session not requried in new spark = get_spark()
This uses get_spark() from:
from pg_tw_fa_marm_reporting.common import get_spark
2)removeDebugTables
removeDebugTables() is intentionally not migrated because the debug logic was removed by design.
3) Managedoutput
integrate to new script
